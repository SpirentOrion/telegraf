Spirent Magellan database API layer

This directory helps prepare the Magellan client and dependency APIs for the magellan output plugin. 
Source code is pulled from the github SpirentOrion repo on "make prepare" of the telegraf build.
There is no plan to push the magellan output plugin to the upstream telegraf repo. Therefore it makes sense to keep it's build resources seperated.
